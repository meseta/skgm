ServerKit GameMaker is an open source control panel to allow easy drag & drop updating and administration of GameMaker servers. For example, the [SKGM Website](https://skgm.meseta.dev) is controlled and aministrated by ServerKit.

SKGM is built in GameMaker, and using the [HTGM web framework](https://htgm.meseta.dev), and is inspired by server administration tools like cPanel.

SKGM was created by [Meseta](https://meseta.dev), released under the MIT open source license, and is free to use for commercial and non-commercial projects. The project is released as-is, and no support or warranties are provided, but those working on GameMaker projects in general may find help from the friendly [GameMaker community on Discord](https://discord.gg/gamemaker).
